I was assured the Netgear nighthawk M6 system was the best option and that it was compatible with my Netgear Orbi Mesh Wifi system. However, they were out of stock in the store and we'd have to order over the phone.
We went home and ordered the device and again was assured it would work perfectly for our needs.
Within 24hrs of receiving the device, we started having connectivity issues.
Over the course of 2 mths and over 13 HOURS of service and tech support calls, we were informed by Netgear the device At&t provided is NOT compatible with our system.
We were then told we could return the device to the store.
Upon returning to the store, we were told the only way to return the device is through the phone customer service since that is how our order originated.
Upon calling the specified number provided by the store, I was transferred 3 times by agents that were assuring me I was being transferred to the appropriate department.
I finally requested the number to call myself. After doing that, I actually called the correct department.
After speaking with an agent that told me I could return the device but would be charged for the device, I asked to speak to a manager.
I have now been on hold for more than 15 minutes waiting for a manager.

This service is absolutely horrible. I was formerly the Director of Consumer Experience for a Fortune 500 company.  Therefore, I understand the difficulties of customer service.  This service is something At&t should be ashamed of.

I will be taking this story to social media and am contemplating switching my service to other providers (cell phones and two business accounts of which we pay more than $600/mth for).","""2024-04-12T01:40:44.000Z""",0,1

100003890425484,"One of the worst customer services I have ever seen.
I wanted to transfer my billing responsibility from my employer's business account to my consumer account. The admin from my employer's account spoke to the ATT and initiated a release from his side. He then asked me to call 611 to initiate the transfer of responsibility from my side.
I called 611 on 7th May 2024 and gave all the details the representative asked for. After almost an hour, the representative said the transfer had been initiated. Since I did not get any intimation, I called again in the evening and learned that the previous representative had entered my email ID incorrectly. After an hour, the new representative told me that the transfer would be complete in the next 48 hours.
The transfer did not happen in 48 hours. I again called back. There was a call drop a couple of times after waiting for 10-15 minutes, and then a representative picked up the call. After listening to my story, she asked me to call another department. The guy in this department wasted another 1.5 hours of my time. He asked me to pay off my pending balance on the phone and told me that the transfer would happen in 24-48 hours. 
The transfer did not happen even after 72 hours. I called back. Again there were a couple of call drops. Finally, a representative picked up the call and said she could not speak on behalf of previous representatives or check the previous transfer requests. However, she could assure that the transfer will be complete this time. Again I spent an hour with her on the phone. In between, she asked me to add my employer to the line to grant the permission. Ultimately, she told me the transfer would be complete in 48 hours, and she had scheduled a call back to confirm the transfer. 
Neither the transfer happened in 48 hours, nor did I recieve a call back from ATT. I called again, explaining the whole story to a new representative. She asked me to add my employer on line for the consent. She then told me that the transfer was done from the business department and wanted to connect me with the consumer department. She put my call on hold which went almost for 1.5 hours. And finally, she had to disconnect as nobody picked up the call from the consumer department.
Then, I myself called the consumer department and a lady named Sheena could help me transfer the line. 
Throughout this entire ordeal, I've dedicated a significant amount of my time, approximately 8-10 hours, engaging with various representatives. Despite my repeated attempts, there seems to be a lack of accountability and a clear process to handle multiple queries on the same request. The waiting time for a call to connect is seemingly infinite, adding to my frustration.

Since I have paid off for my phone, I wanted to unlock the device. I tried doing it online to see a note: ""Please try after 60 days"". Per the policy, the device can be unlocked after 48 hours of payoff. The reason was that since my consumer account is new, it takes 60 days. My question was, if they treated the business and consumer departments as different entities, how did the business account still lock my phone even after I paid it off? Should they not unlock before releasing the phone to a different entity? Is there no checklist in place? And is it legal for a consumer entity to get a phone that is already locked by someone else? I don't know whom to ask. Because, as usual, customer care representatives have no answers.","""2024-05-17T02:55:13.000Z""",0,2

Advised I have to send my phone in for up to 2 weeks. Find a friend or loaner on my own dime and get compensation of 50$ for my time. 

Or drive over an hour to a Samsung repair shop... but wait... there's more....

Best thing about this. Their tech team had me take my phone to a repair shop who recommended replacement. Now Samsung is saying they never said that and the repair shops statement is not valid.

Oh, ya. Or pay 300$ to upgrade to the S24. 

Or pay AT&T 300$ for a replacement phone.  

Neither AT&T nor Samsung are willing to admit the issue. Google and check reddit. The S22 Ultra series and multiple S23 are having this issue. 

I've done every check their advanced tech team requested me to.

I have a business phone agreement with AT&T and
upgraded my two cell phones approximately 6 months ago.
The initial upgrade was handled via mail, the phones were
received as expected, and the old phones were mailed
back to AT&T. The credit for the phone upgrade was to be
seen on our monthly phone bill and was to cover the
complete cost of the phone upgrade. One of the phones did
not fit our needs and as per our agreement with AT&T, we
returned the phone and exchanged it at a retail store during
the 15-day trial period that AT&T provided for trying the new
phones (It was just a few days after the phone was
received). A few months later when checking the monthly
invoice I noticed that the credit for one of the phones was
not being received. I reached out to AT&T and they told me
that this was a common problem and that retail stores were

Continued on next Page

not supposed to take back or exchange business phones.
Please note that the retail store assured us the exchange at
the store was fine. We were assured during our first call with
AT&T that the phone credit would be applied and we would
see it on our bill in a month. It is now about 5 months and
several calls later and we have still not seen any credit. I am
just off the line with an AT&T agent and they acknowledged
the issue was on their end but stated that they could not do
anything at this point. I feel this internal AT&T issue is not
only affecting me by taking my valuable time but also
costing me well over $1000 in the cost of a new phone. Can
you please look into this and let me know what can be
done. Any assistance is greatly appreciated.

After posting here I got 4 answers from 4 different people saying let‚Äôs work this out as a team. The last person Lisa left a text as well as a voice mail.  The voice mail first gave the WRONG NUMBER to call back on.  Once I had the correct number and called that the #3 prompt she said to use asked for a 13 digit account number.  Mine is 9 and after entering that AT&T automatically disconnected me.

I am now back on hold for a second time on a different number and have wasted an additional 30 minutes this afternoon in an attempt to resolve the issue which AT&T seems to have no interest NOR commitment to resolve though a person that can actually do so.  

It seems the business model is to pass customers around and never resolving anything with someone who actually knows what they are doing and can do so.

After spending more than an hour on the phone with the third representative I was passed around to yesterday afternoon it became clear that the toll free line I cancelled in Novemeber, and one of my employees followed up to make sure was cancelled in December, when he called to ask about a final bill, had not yet been cancelled.  Supposedly this third representative NOW put in a request to cancel the line.  However, she could not do anything about the December and January bill that I have received for calls received 2 Months AFTER cancelling the line.  As the line first had to be diconnect d and she had no notes in the account as to the November and December calls.  

To believe that a company that can‚Äôt even give the correct call back numbers, plus asks for an account number that is 4 digits more than what our account t number is, keeps accurate notes and records, is flabbergasting at the least. 

To pretend they have an interest in working something out as a ‚Äúteam‚Äù is nice words but are neither authentic nor do they have any integrity.  They simply are the ‚Äúright or good‚Äù thing to say and have absolutely NO substance.  

I was an AT&T customer for over 20 years and spent close to $1,000.00/month on my business phones.  Today I spend less than $200.00/month for the same number of lines, unlimited international data and extremely LOW international calling fees when not connected to wifi with Google-Fi.

At this very moment I am on my probably 15th phone call since Sept 12 2023.  I spent 3 hours and 40 mins on the phone with your Business Loyalty Department on Sept 12 when I requested my service terminated and my phones unlocked so that I could move them to a different provider.  They told me my account balance would need to be zero and my installments would need to be paid in full, which I took care of while on that phone call.  Over $800 paid.  My service was not terminated and my phones were not unlocked.  I have spent the last 3 months calling and calling and calling.  Over 8 hours of my life on the phone to AT&T.  And the first 6 of those phone calls to the Business Loyalty Department, after I explained all of this to whomever was on the other end, the call went silent.  Not disconnected, just no one there.  I even went to my local AT&T owned store and the Assistant Manager and I were on hold for 1 hour and 17 mins just for the line to go silent after my explanation.  Since then I have talked to 3 Supervisors and countless other people in Business Loyalty, Collections and right now I have been on the phone for 48 mins with Technical Support and they now have not come back on the line.  This is the absolute most ridiculous behavior from one of the largest, oldest companies in the WORLD.  I keep getting notifications telling me my bill is now over $1350.  I have a paid for iPhone 11 that I cannot use, I cannot get business cards for my new business printed and I can‚Äôt give anyone anything but a temporary phone number for me because AT&T will NOT DO WHAT THEY CONTINUE TO PROMISE ME WILL BE DONE.  And it is impossible to talk with anyone who has the ability to make a decision on this matter within the organization because NO ONE can.  I was actually told that a ticket would need to be generated to their back office team to have the situation reviewed.  It would take 7-10 business days and this department did not have any inbound lines to it where I could talk to these people who would ultimately be responsible for settling this matter.  Which they haven‚Äôt because it has been escalated twice already to the 7-10 day program and once last week to a 3-day program and still NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.  MY PHONES ARE STILL USELESS AND MY BILL CONTINUES TO ACCRUE CHARGES.   

So if you‚Äôre considering AT&T Business, I would check around elsewhere because apparently they have no interest in listening to or helping their current customers.

Calling in is a cruel form of punishment meant to chill the complaints that they so rightly deserve.  
It is worse because the recently suffered a data breach of customer information.  So in reality it is I the customer that suffered the data breach.

In 2019, I sat at my computer; and in 2020 my autobiography, PLANET EARTH-ONE DAY IN SCHOOL, was published at Amazon with 13-five-star-reviews (B08KH3QMB6). The two themes are: 1) My Metaphysical Journey from poor immigrant Italian grandparents in Jersey City, N.J. to a Doctorate in Metaphysics and a move to Denver, CO. 2) Racial Restoration. In a Past Life Workshop, I experienced a young black girl with pigtails, who lived on a southern plantation; and a male wearing a wig, who could be one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. A black person can have a past life being white, and a white supremest can have a past life being black. Can we all join together and BE ALL THAT WE CAN BE?

I am hoping that someone calls me back to acknowledge my complaint.  I would hate to think that after all off the effort to contact my carrier and then going to the effort to lodge a complaint that I will get a call back.  Thank you and I look forward to reaching some resolution.","""2024-04-10T01:01:09.000Z""",0,0

Back in October, I had called about some questions I had with my account. I was talked into getting 2 new phones- I would trade in my iPhone 12 for an iPhone 15Pro and because my husbands phone had cracked, we were getting an iPhone 13 for him for $0.99. The first thing that happened, the sales guy never did something on the ATT end for my trade in. I spent literal hours on the phone with ATT multiple times and FINALLY was able to get my phone traded in. However, for my husbands phone we were being charged $17.50 instead of the $0.05/ month (the $0.99 divided into monthly costs). I called a few times about it and each time I was told that yes, that is the promotion and I had to wait 3 billing cycles for the account to catch up to the $0.05/month instead of the $17.50/month. So on the third billing cycle it wasn‚Äôt fixed. I called and they told me because it had been three billing cycles they couldn‚Äôt remove it. The person I spoke with requested a $630 credit for the iPhone 13 (which is what I would be charged over the course of the installment payments), because they can‚Äôt remove the $17.50/ month off of my bill. It was approved while I was on the phone with her. She had told me that it would hit my account in 24 hours. 

I have been a customer for years. This is the messiest customer service experience I‚Äôve ever had. I have NEVER had such a large business lie to me continuously and continuously mess up my account. The phone calls are all recorded, there needs to be an investigation. I will be filing a complaint with the FTC. I have been patient and understanding, but I‚Äôm done. This is not how paying customers, should be treated.

Here is the hilarious response from AT&T Business. Save yourself the headache and go with Verizon. 

‚ÄúNichole, I had my team look into your husband's line concerns. Here are the findings, They did not put his line on the 2-year commitment which would have been 99 cents for the device, but they did not inform you that if you were on that then your rate plan for the line would have jumped from $30 to $55 for the 2 years and that would have been a total of an extra 25 dollars for 24 months and a total of $600.00. They put his line on the installment plan for $17.50 for the 36 months for the device and the plan stays the same at $30, so he is paying a total of $630 we can give the difference of 30 dollars as a credit. Please let me know if you have any other questions. -Lisa‚Äù","""2024-01-05T21:46:13.000Z""",0,0

Back in October, I had called about some questions I had with my account. I was talked into getting 2 new phones- I would trade in my iPhone 12 for an iPhone 15Pro and because my husbands phone had cracked, we were getting an iPhone 13 for him for $0.99. The first thing that happened, the sales guy never did something on the ATT end for my trade in. I spent literal hours on the phone with ATT multiple times and FINALLY was able to get my phone traded in. However, for my husbands phone we were being charged $17.50 instead of the $0.05/ month (the $0.99 divided into monthly costs). I called a few times about it and each time I was told that yes, that is the promotion and I had to wait 3 billing cycles for the account to catch up to the $0.05/month instead of the $17.50/month. So on the third billing cycle it wasn‚Äôt fixed. I called and they told me because it had been three billing cycles they couldn‚Äôt remove it. The person I spoke with requested a $630 credit for the iPhone 13 (which is what I would be charged over the course of the installment payments), because they can‚Äôt remove the $17.50/ month off of my bill. It was approved while I was on the phone with her. She had told me that it would hit my account in 24 hours. 

I have been a customer for years. This is the messiest customer service experience I‚Äôve ever had. I have NEVER had such a large business lie to me continuously and continuously mess up my account. The phone calls are all recorded, there needs to be an investigation. I WILL be filing a complaint with the FTC. I have been patient and understanding, but I‚Äôm done.

When we went to renew they quoted us a price with our own equipment that we own and a price using their equipment that we would need to purchase.

Under contract our bill was under $300. When I called they left me on hold for over an hour. Then I spent the next hour haggling with customer service agent that spoke very little English and we had a bad connection!!!! We finally came to an agreement to extend for one year.

100066479895779,"A Storm is Coming: The Hidden Collapse of an Industry and the Future of North Texas""
Imagine the storm of a lifetime‚Äînot one of thunder and rain, but of flashing lights, roaring sirens, and lives torn apart. Picture this: workers clinging to rooftops, their tools clattering to the ground as ICE vehicles swarm. A crew, gone in an instant. A contractor, vanished. A home, half-roofed and exposed to the sky, waiting helplessly for the rain to destroy everything beneath it.
This isn‚Äôt just a nightmare‚Äîit‚Äôs the looming reality for Texans as mass deportations promise to rip apart the foundation of an industry built on exploitation. What happens when 92% of your labor force is wiped out overnight? When unfinished homes sit exposed to ruin? When families, businesses, and entire communities are left stranded by policies that punish the powerless while letting the guilty walk free?
""Exposed: The Collapse of an Industry, a Community, and a Roof Over Texans‚Äô Heads"" is not just an article; it‚Äôs a wake-up call. A chilling exploration of greed, broken systems, and the human cost of political theater. From the rooftops of North Texas to the corporations that profited from this chaos, this story uncovers the untold truth about a labor crisis years in the making‚Äîand the storm about to break.
If you think you‚Äôre safe, you‚Äôre wrong. This isn‚Äôt just about roofs. It‚Äôs about livelihoods, trust, and the very fabric of our communities.
The question isn‚Äôt whether the storm will come‚Äîit‚Äôs whether you‚Äôll be ready when it does. Read the article that‚Äôs already making waves‚Äîand prepare to see the truth laid bare.

61553498957151,"Sounds like there are a lot of people with the same experience as me. Customer service tells you ""about"" what your bill will be after your ""credits"", but it takes up to 3 months. Then your bill is triple or double that, even after activation fees, more fees, and customer service just gives you the run around, since it is a screwed up credit system which is what seems to get them out of fair consumer services. 

I am stuck in a 3 year contract with a bill double what I was told in the store and multiple times on the phone after my first bills were triple that. 

Go here and share your story and to keep other people from getting into their contracts and if there is enough of us, there will be legal action we can take.

Back in October, I had called about some questions I had with my account. I was talked into getting 2 new phones- I would trade in my iPhone 12 for an iPhone 15Pro and because my husbands phone had cracked, we were getting an iPhone 13 for him for $0.99. The first thing that happened, the sales guy never did something on the ATT end for my trade in. I spent literal hours on the phone with ATT multiple times and FINALLY was able to get my phone traded in. However, for my husbands phone we were being charged $17.50 instead of the $0.05/ month (the $0.99 divided into monthly costs). I called a few times about it and each time I was told that yes, that is the promotion and I had to wait 3 billing cycles for the account to catch up to the $0.05/month instead of the $17.50/month. So on the third billing cycle it wasn‚Äôt fixed. I called and they told me because it had been three billing cycles they couldn‚Äôt remove it. The person I spoke with requested a $630 credit for the iPhone 13 (which is what I would be charged over the course of the installment payments), because they can‚Äôt remove the $17.50/ month off of my bill. It was approved while I was on the phone with her. She had told me that it would hit my account in 24 hours. 

I have been a customer for years. This is the messiest customer service experience I‚Äôve ever had. I have NEVER had such a large business lie to me continuously and continuously mess up my account. The phone calls are all recorded, there needs to be an investigation. I will be filing a complaint with the FTC. I have been patient and understanding, but I‚Äôm done. This is not how paying customers, should be treated.

Here is the hilarious response from AT&T Business. Save yourself the headache and go with Verizon. 

‚ÄúNichole, I had my team look into your husband's line concerns. Here are the findings, They did not put his line on the 2-year commitment which would have been 99 cents for the device, but they did not inform you that if you were on that then your rate plan for the line would have jumped from $30 to $55 for the 2 years and that would have been a total of an extra 25 dollars for 24 months and a total of $600.00. They put his line on the installment plan for $17.50 for the 36 months for the device and the plan stays the same at $30, so he is paying a total of $630 we can give the difference of 30 dollars as a credit. Please let me know if you have any other questions. -Lisa‚Äù","""2024-01-05T21:45:50.000Z""",0,0

Back in October, I had called about some questions I had with my account. I was talked into getting 2 new phones- I would trade in my iPhone 12 for an iPhone 15Pro and because my husbands phone had cracked, we were getting an iPhone 13 for him for $0.99. The first thing that happened, the sales guy never did something on the ATT end for my trade in. I spent literal hours on the phone with ATT multiple times and FINALLY was able to get my phone traded in. However, for my husbands phone we were being charged $17.50 instead of the $0.05/ month (the $0.99 divided into monthly costs). I called a few times about it and each time I was told that yes, that is the promotion and I had to wait 3 billing cycles for the account to catch up to the $0.05/month instead of the $17.50/month. So on the third billing cycle it wasn‚Äôt fixed. I called and they told me because it had been three billing cycles they couldn‚Äôt remove it. The person I spoke with requested a $630 credit for the iPhone 13 (which is what I would be charged over the course of the installment payments), because they can‚Äôt remove the $17.50/ month off of my bill. It was approved while I was on the phone with her. She had told me that it would hit my account in 24 hours. 

I have been a customer for years. This is the messiest customer service experience I‚Äôve ever had. I have NEVER had such a large business lie to me continuously and continuously mess up my account. The phone calls are all recorded, there needs to be an investigation. I will be filing a complaint with the FTC. I have been patient and understanding, but I‚Äôm done. This is not how paying customers, should be treated.

Here is the hilarious response from AT&T Business. Save yourself the headache and go with Verizon. 

‚ÄúNichole, I had my team look into your husband's line concerns. Here are the findings, They did not put his line on the 2-year commitment which would have been 99 cents for the device, but they did not inform you that if you were on that then your rate plan for the line would have jumped from $30 to $55 for the 2 years and that would have been a total of an extra 25 dollars for 24 months and a total of $600.00. They put his line on the installment plan for $17.50 for the 36 months for the device and the plan stays the same at $30, so he is paying a total of $630 we can give the difference of 30 dollars as a credit. Please let me know if you have any other questions. -Lisa‚Äù","""2024-01-05T21:46:03.000Z""",0,0

They will not connect to the network and intermittently if at all connect for phone calls or texts. I paid full price for this phone when I purchased it, I also pay monthly for the protection and now when Verizon has produced a product that they know is not working is refusing to acknowledge the need for replacement. My phone has been experiencing this issue for a week now. I have been to a physical Verizon store front where their big help was dialing the Verizon support number and handing me the phone, I have also spent hours out of each day with unhelpful rude people from Verizon support who only know how to say ""I'm sorry you are experiencing issues i wish there was something i could do to help"" It was so bad at one point the lady from Verizon support dared to tell me there was nothing wrong with my phone it was ""a network phenomenon"" YOU MUST BE JOKING. The gentlmen at the store finially stepped in and told me that this is an issue they are aware of and that 3 other people just that afternoon with S22s had been in with the same issue. It is a Samsung issue. They made a bad phone. After all the phones they put out I understand theres a bound to be a bad egg every once and a while. My issue is that neither Samsung with adverage salary for their executives being 5.3 million in 2021 per (https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2022&no=156931) and Verizon CEO making 19.38 Million per year per (https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/telecom/nyse-vz/verizon-communications/management#:~:text=Verizon%20Communications'%20CEO%20is%20Hans,company's%20shares%2C%20worth%20%2419.61M.)  In addition to both companies reported revenue being in the hundreds of BILLION dollars that's billion with a B. Why does this issue fall on the wallets of the consumer struggling to make ends meet. To afford groceries. Why is the consumer constantly being put out for giant corporations mistakes.  I want action, I want accountability. You produced a bad phone so make right on it and send us all new ones. Instead of passing the buck yet again to the consumer. However I should not be surprised that this is where we are at as Verizon is known for their Breach of Contract standard operating procedure as proven by the recent Lawsuit for that very reason. What's worse is they don't care at all because what are you going to do about it. Change carriers? They don't even pretend to care anymore. You are a simple drop in the bucket of their billion dollar yearly revenue. The days of consumer power are over. ""The man"" has won.","""2024-03-20T13:19:36.000Z""",0,0

Back in October, I had called about some questions I had with my account. I was talked into getting 2 new phones- I would trade in my iPhone 12 for an iPhone 15Pro and because my husbands phone had cracked, we were getting an iPhone 13 for him for $0.99. The first thing that happened, the sales guy never did something on the ATT end for my trade in. I spent literal hours on the phone with ATT multiple times and FINALLY was able to get my phone traded in. However, for my husbands phone we were being charged $17.50 instead of the $0.05/ month (the $0.99 divided into monthly costs). I called a few times about it and each time I was told that yes, that is the promotion and I had to wait 3 billing cycles for the account to catch up to the $0.05/month instead of the $17.50/month. So on the third billing cycle it wasn‚Äôt fixed. I called and they told me because it had been three billing cycles they couldn‚Äôt remove it. The person I spoke with requested a $630 credit for the iPhone 13 (which is what I would be charged over the course of the installment payments), because they can‚Äôt remove the $17.50/ month off of my bill. It was approved while I was on the phone with her. She had told me that it would hit my account in 24 hours. 

I have been a customer for years. This is the messiest customer service experience I‚Äôve ever had. I have NEVER had such a large business lie to me continuously and continuously mess up my account. The phone calls are all recorded, there needs to be an investigation. I will be filing a complaint with the FTC. I have been patient and understanding, but I‚Äôm done. This is not how paying customers, should be treated.

Here is the hilarious response from AT&T Business. Save yourself the headache and go with Verizon. 

‚ÄúNichole, I had my team look into your husband's line concerns. Here are the findings, They did not put his line on the 2-year commitment which would have been 99 cents for the device, but they did not inform you that if you were on that then your rate plan for the line would have jumped from $30 to $55 for the 2 years and that would have been a total of an extra 25 dollars for 24 months and a total of $600.00. They put his line on the installment plan for $17.50 for the 36 months for the device and the plan stays the same at $30, so he is paying a total of $630 we can give the difference of 30 dollars as a credit. Please let me know if you have any other questions. -Lisa‚Äù","""2024-01-05T21:46:21.000Z""",0,0
